### Basics of eGame

**eGame** is a website that I created to act similar to ebay but purely for hardcopy games. A user can create an account and add games to their personal library so that they can easily keep track of all their games. The user can go back and edit any details about their game and delete a game from their library if they wish. There is also a store on **eGame** where you will see all games that are posted for sale by all other users on the website. You can view the details of a game in the store buy simply clicking on it and once you purchase a game it will be taken off the store and added to your personal library.

I used *JavaScript*, *HTML*, *CSS* and *MongoDB* to help me build this game.
